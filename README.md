This hack allows you to make a direct call to T-mobile customer service representative so that you do not have to wait on hold for hours hoping that someone will talk to you. You can simply provide us with your phone number to call you, your email address for the recorded conversation and press the button to call. The app will handle the waiting for you and it will give you a call back when the service representative is available.
